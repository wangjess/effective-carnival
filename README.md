# effective-carnival

Effective Carnival is the place where dreams come true. If you want to be a porpoise that eats sea pretzels while swimming
in the deep blue sea, you can do that. If you want to become a tiny little pinto bean and pretend you're storing your energy
using the move Bide, you can do that. It's the place where the universe convalesces into a tiny speck of the darkest black.
But in the middle lies a beautiful shining ruby.
